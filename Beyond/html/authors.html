                 Ian Anderson is a scientist, his daughters Sabrina and Rebecca are both medical doctors, specialized in neonatology and paediatric intensive care. Although they live on different continents, there is nothing they like better than getting together to discover new horizons, encountering different cultures, diverse landscapes and getting to know the world “Beyond”. 
             </p> 
             <p> 
                Sabrina and Rebecca have both worked as physicians in Africa and became enchanted with Ethiopia during their many visits volunteering as doctors in Gondar and Addis Ababa. Sabrina was inspired by one of her journeys to Ghana in 2002 to paint her impressions and sell those paintings at an exhibition in Jena, Germany, to raise funds for an orphanage in India.<br> Rebecca has also spent time in Haiti and Lebanon, volunteering for Doctors Without Borders.

                Although they have published widely in their professional lives this is their first travel book.
